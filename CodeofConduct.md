This community is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community
for everyone.
We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form.
This does not only extend to members of the community, but to anyone who chooses
to become involved in the larger community of users, developers and integrators
through events or interactions.

Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal
characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces,
deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography
or recording, sustained disruption of talks, chats, electronic meetings,
physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
or unwelcome sexual attention.
Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the community
may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender,
expulsion from any event, or expulsion from mailing lists, chats,
discussion boards and other electronic communications channels to resolve the issue.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from
any member of the community, chat admins, website admins, or
organizers/representatives of any physical events put on under
the auspices of PyLadies.
